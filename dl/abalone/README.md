# Abalone

## Description

The dataset is about Abalone, a kind of mollusca.

Here are some explanations about the variables:

- Sex: M, F and I (for Male, Female and Infant).
- Length: Longest shell measurement.
- Diameter: perpendicular to length.
- Height: with meat in shell.
- Whole weight: whole abalone.
- Shucked weight: weight of meat.
- Viscera weight: gut weight (after bleeding).
- Shell weight: after being dried.
- Rings: +1.5 gives the age in years.

**The goal is to perform a regression on the variable "Rings".**

## Missions

1. Load the data set.
2. Make a brief explanatory analysis (graphics, statistics, etc.).
3. Prepare the data in order to perform a regression on the variable "Rings" with a neural network.
4. Build a neural network with Keras to solve this regression problem.
5. Compile the model, monitor it and study its performance.
